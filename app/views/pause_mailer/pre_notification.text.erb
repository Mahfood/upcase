Hi there!

You paused your Upcase subscription on <%= @pause_date %> and it's about to restart on <%= 2.days.from_now.strftime("%A") %>. We wanted to give you a heads up beforehand in case you've changed your mind about starting up again.

If you don't want to restart your Upcase subscription, you can cancel it on your My Account page.

As a reminder, we've saved your progress on all trails, videos, and exercises.

Thanks, and we'll see you soon!
